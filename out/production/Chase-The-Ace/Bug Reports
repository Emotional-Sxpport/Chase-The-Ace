BUGS WITH THE CODE
- if two ai's lose in a round, both are eliminated and the remaining is duplicated
    - if two ai's lose, the last one seems to be eliminated, even if they didnt lose
        - i had a round with J(me) 5 5 K --> K was eliminated
- no next round
- sometimes ai's aren't eliminated
    - i had a round where the last ai to go (who was also the furthest right) lost
        and wasnt eliminated
